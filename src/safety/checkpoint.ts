// src/safety/checkpoint.ts
//
// "git checkpoint per node (not per whole task) — this granularity is what
// enables partial rollback." — 07_SAFETY_SYSTEM.md
//
// REAL git, not mocked: each node gets its own commit; rollback is
// `git revert <that commit's sha>`, not a hard reset to some earlier point
// in history. A hard reset would also undo any sibling commits made after
// this node's; a targeted revert only undoes this node's own diff.
//
// Two DIFFERENT concurrency concerns, easy to conflate, kept deliberately
// separate:
//   1. Content races — does node A's checkpoint ever revert over node B's
//      still-needed change? Prevented by the Execution Engine's file-level
//      locking (05): a node never runs concurrently with another node
//      touching the same paths, and never starts before its own
//      dependencies have already resolved to success. So a revert's target
//      commit can never have an unrelated sibling commit "underneath" it
//      that the revert would corrupt.
//   2. Mechanical races — two `git commit` calls hitting the same repo's
//      HEAD ref at the same instant. File-level locking does NOT prevent
//      this: two nodes with zero file-path overlap (e.g. one writing
//      config.json, one just generating docs with no filePaths at all) are
//      allowed to execute fully concurrently per 05, but they still share
//      one git repository with one HEAD ref. This was a real bug, not a
//      hypothetical: it surfaced as `fatal: cannot lock ref 'HEAD'` when
//      demoing two non-overlapping parallel nodes. Fixed below with an
//      internal FIFO queue (an `AsyncMutex`) so every git-mutating operation
//      this class performs — checkpoint, rollback — is serialized
//      regardless of file paths. This only serializes the (fast) git calls
//      themselves; the actual executor work for non-overlapping nodes still
//      runs fully concurrently, since the lock is acquired right before the
//      git commands and released right after.
//
// Per 04/07 (see taskGraph/graph.ts docblock): a failed node's direct
// dependents are marked 'blocked' but never executed, so they never get a
// checkpoint to revert in the first place. Rollback here is always exactly
// one commit.
